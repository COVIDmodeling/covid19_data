Ran three scenarios – low, medium and high impact – based on assumptions of varying degrees of losses for tourist arrivals over a four-month period.Government has adopted a package of policy measures to deal with the tremendous economic impact of COVID-19 that is already starting to be felt as hotel occupancies have fallen, as cruise ship arrivals are on a 30-day hiatus, and as hotel workers are being asked to take unpaid or vacation leave. (Government Package of Policy Measures to Deal with Economic Impact of COVID-19).  $5 million government has already earmarked for healthcare response, and allocating up to an additional $11 million to cover detection, isolation, treatment and other COVID-19 mitigation activities. Government is allocating $10 million to provide for a temporary unemployment benefit, administered through the National Insurance Board, for self-employed persons working in the tourism industry. Government is making a special accommodation for those self-employed individuals in the tourism industry, given the unprecedented COVID-19 impact and will offer a sponsored unemployment assistance of $200 per week, for up to eight weeks.
